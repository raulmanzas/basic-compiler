# basic-compiler

This repository contains a simple implementation of a compiler for the C- language. No frameworks, it was all written from scratch for learning purposes. Features implemented so far:

* Lexical analysis (without regex)
* Syntactical analysis (recursive descent)
* Semantical analysis
* Customized symbol table

You can see some C- source code [here](https://github.com/raulmanzas/basic-compiler/tree/master/testfiles).

[The grammar I followed can be found here.](http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/).
